The meshes, textures, and animations that you create for your projects are known as *source assets*. **Asset Pipeline** processes source assets to generate runtime-optimized *product assets* that you can use in your **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** projects. The tutorials in this section cover all the basics of using the **Scene Settings** tool to customize how Asset Processor generates product assets.
