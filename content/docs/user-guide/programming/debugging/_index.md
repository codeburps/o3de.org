Sometimes, things go wrong or are unexpected and you need tools to track down the problem. **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** provides the tools to help you debug the engine and your project.

Various systems throughout the engine also have console variables (CVARs) that you can configure to debug a system. For more information, see the [CVARs](/docs/user-guide/appendix/cvars/) section.
