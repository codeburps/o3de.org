To support multiple native build toolchains, **Open 3D Engine** (O3DE) uses the [CMake build tools](https://cmake.org/). While most configurable build systems make it difficult to work cross-platform, CMake is intentionally designed to take generic configuration files and generate toolchain-specific project files, and then perform native builds.

 Once you've [registered O3DE](/docs/welcome-guide/setup) and [created an O3DE project](/docs/user-guide/project-config/project-manager/#creating-projects-using-project-manager), you can build your project with these commands:

{{< tabs name="CMake configure example" >}}
{{% tab name="Windows" %}}

```cmd
cd <project-directory>
cmake -B build/windows -S . -G "Visual Studio 16" -DLY_3RDPARTY_PATH=<absolute-path-to-packages>
cmake --build build/windows --target <ProjectName>.GameLauncher Editor --config profile -- -m
```

{{< note >}}
Use `Visual Studio 16` as the generator for Visual Studio 2019, and `Visual Studio 17` for Visual Studio 2022. For a complete list of common generators for each supported platform, refer to [Configuring projects](./configure-and-build/#configuring-projects).
{{< /note >}}

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Linux" %}}

```shell
cd <project-directory>
cmake -B build/linux -S . -G "Ninja Multi-Config" -DLY_3RDPARTY_PATH=<absolute-path-to-packages>
cmake --build build/linux --target <ProjectName>.GameLauncher Editor --config profile
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Builds created with these commands are located in the `<project-directory>/<build-directory>/bin/profile` directory.

Refer to [Configure and Build](configure-and-build) for a list of other build configurations.

O3DE requires CMake {{< versions/cmake >}} or higher.
